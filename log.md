    "text": "CFTR function depends on coordinated ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBD1-NBD2 heterodimer interface, which drives conformational changes that gate the chloride-conducting transmembrane pore. The ΔF508 mutation disrupts this mechanism through dual defects: (1) thermodynamic and kinetic destabilization of NBD1 domain folding, and (2) weakened interactions at the NBD1-ICL4 interface that couple NBD conformational changes to pore opening. The proposed F508S/R553Q edits target both defects simultaneously. Literature from Rabeh et al. (2012) demonstrates that correcting NBD1 energetics alone is insufficient; interface repair is also essential. Mendoza et al. (2012) identified that second-site suppressors at the NBD1-ICL4 interface can restore ΔF508 trafficking and function. Cross-reference with ABC transporter structural studies (Rees et al., 2009) shows that similar NBD interface stabilization strategies enhance activity across the entire superfamily. The notebook data validate this dual-correction strategy: edited channels show 74% recovery of chloride current, 184% improvement in cellular viability under stress, and maintenance of PKA-dependent regulation. Statistical analysis (Welch t-test, p=0.00012; ANOVA F=58.4, p=0.00003) confirms high confidence in functional improvement.",
