# üß¨ DEMO NOTEBOOK: GFP Mutation Analysis

**Project:** GFP Brightness Enhancement  
**Researcher:** Dr. Alex Chen  
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Goal:** Test if S65A mutation improves GFP brightness  
**Quick Summary:** Comparing wild-type GFP vs S65A mutant

---

## üìù Research Background

We're testing if the **S65A mutation** (Serine ‚Üí Alanine at position 65) improves GFP brightness.

**Hypothesis:** Removing the hydroxyl group at position 65 might improve chromophore packing and increase fluorescence.

**Why this matters:**
- Ser65 is right next to Tyr66, which forms the fluorescent chromophore
- We want to test if changing this residue affects brightness
- Literature suggests S65T works well, but S65A hasn't been tested much

**Question for AI:** 
- Is S65A more pH-sensitive than WT?
- Which pH range is optimal for both variants?
- Does this suggest chromophore environment differences?

---

## ü§î Initial Observations

**What we see from the data:**
- **Expression:** S65A is ~12% lower than WT (10.8 vs 12.2 mg/L)
- **Fluorescence:** S65A is ~6% dimmer than WT (93.9 vs 100.0 RFU)
- **Photobleaching:** S65A bleaches MUCH faster (26.9% remaining vs 57.5% for WT at 120 sec)
- **pH Sensitivity:** S65A appears more sensitive to pH changes, especially at acidic pH

**Big Question:** Is this mutation worth pursuing, or should we try S65T instead?

- Calculate p-values and 95% confidence intervals
- **Power:** With n=9 per group, we have 80%+ power to detect medium effects (d=0.5) at Œ±=0.05

### 2. Curve Fitting & Kinetics
- Fit exponential decay model: F(t) = F‚ÇÄ √ó e^(-k√ót)
- Calculate decay constants (k) for both variants
- Calculate half-lives (t‚ÇÅ/‚ÇÇ = ln(2)/k)
- Compare decay rates - how much faster does S65A bleach?

### 3. Mechanistic Insight
- Why is S65A worse than WT?
- What molecular interactions does Ser65 hydroxyl group provide?
- Does removing the OH group destabilize the chromophore?
- Create a protein interaction network showing Ser65 connections

### 4. Literature Cross-Reference
- What do other studies say about S65A vs S65T mutations?
- Find published data on S65T performance (brightness, photostability)
- Pull PubMed articles and structural data

### 5. Next Experiment Recommendation
- Should we abandon S65A and try S65T?
- Predict S65T performance with confidence intervals:
  - Expected brightness increase?
  - Expected photostability improvement?
  - Expression levels?

## üìà Expected AI Output

### Part 1: Statistical Analysis Results

**Statistical Summary:**
- "S65A shows significantly lower expression (p=__), fluorescence (p=__), and photostability (p=__)..."
- "Effect sizes are large (Cohen's d > 0.8), indicating practically meaningful differences..."
- "Photobleaching analysis: S65A decays __% faster (k_S65A = __, k_WT = __, p<0.001)..."

### Part 2: Protein Interaction Network Graph

**What the Graph Should Show:**

An interactive network graph displaying how the S65A mutation affects nearby amino acid residues around the chromophore.

**Residues (Nodes) in the Network:**

| Residue | Role | Effect of S65A | Importance | Color |
|---------|------|----------------|------------|-------|
| **Ser65** | Mutation site | MUTATION SITE | Highest (hub residue) | üî¥ Red (large) |
| **Tyr66** | Forms chromophore | CRITICAL LOSS | Very high | üî¥ Red |
| **Glu222** | H-bond acceptor | CRITICAL LOSS | High | üî¥ Red |
| **His148** | Proton relay | CRITICAL LOSS | High | üî¥ Red |
| **Arg96** | Electrostatic partner | WEAKENED | Medium | üü° Orange |
| **Gly67** | Backbone flexibility | WEAKENED | Medium | üü° Orange |
| **Phe64** | Hydrophobic support | MAINTAINED | Low | üü¢ Green |

**Interactions (Edges) in the Network:**

| From | To | Type | Strength (kcal/mol) | Distance (√Ö) | Effect of S65A | Color |
|------|-----|------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Ser65 | Tyr66 | H-bond | -2.8 | 1.5 | **LOST** | üîµ Blue (thick) |
| Ser65 | Glu222 | H-bond | -3.2 | 2.8 | **LOST** | üîµ Blue (thickest) |
| Ser65 | His148 | H-bond (water) | -1.5 | 3.2 | **WEAKENED** | üîµ Light blue |
| Ser65 | Arg96 | Electrostatic | -1.8 | 4.1 | **LOST** | üî¥ Red |
| Ser65 | Gly67 | H-bond | -2.5 | 1.5 | **LOST** | üîµ Blue (thick) |
| Ser65 | Phe64 | Hydrophobic | -1.2 | 3.8 | **MAINTAINED** | ‚ö´ Gray |
| Tyr66 | Arg96 | Cation-œÄ | -2.1 | 3.6 | **WEAKENED** | üü° Orange |

**Visual Design:**
- **Node size** = Importance in network (Ser65 is largest as the hub)
- **Node color** = Red (critical), Orange (weakened), Green (maintained)
- **Edge thickness** = Interaction strength (thicker = stronger)
- **Edge color** = Interaction type (Blue = H-bond, Red = electrostatic, Gray = hydrophobic)

**Graph Caption:**

"Protein interaction network showing how S65A mutation disrupts the GFP chromophore environment. Ser65 (large red node) is the most critical hub residue, connected to 6 nearby residues. The mutation causes loss of 4 critical H-bonds (blue connections) to Tyr66, Glu222, His148, and Gly67, totaling -10.0 kcal/mol of lost stabilization energy. This cascade of disruptions explains the 6% brightness loss and 30% faster photobleaching observed in our experiments. Only hydrophobic interactions (gray) remain intact. **Solution:** S65T mutation would preserve the hydroxyl group, restoring these critical H-bonds while adding a methyl group to optimize chromophore packing."

**Key Insight:**

Ser65 acts as a central hub connecting the chromophore to the protein scaffold through multiple H-bonds. Removing the hydroxyl group (S65A) breaks this network, destabilizing the excited state and causing faster photobleaching.

### Part 3: Literature & Recommendation

**Mechanistic Insight:**
- "Ser65 hydroxyl group forms 4 critical H-bonds stabilizing the chromophore excited state"
- "Network analysis shows Ser65 is the #1 hub residue (centrality = 0.285)"
- "S65A disrupts 72% of the interaction network (-10 kcal/mol total energy loss)"

**Recommendation:**
- "Based on this data and literature evidence (127+ studies), pursue **S65T** instead."
- "Predicted S65T performance: +35% brightness, +30% photostability (95% CI: [32-38%, 27-33%])."
- "S65T maintains the hydroxyl group (restores H-bonds) while adding a methyl group (optimizes packing)."
